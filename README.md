### STROOP Launcher/Updater

When this program is run, it launches your existing STROOP version, and then installs the newest version in the background if there is one.

It installs the latest dev version from [the STROOP repo](https://github.com/SM64-TAS-ABC/STROOP).

To use this program, download the zip from the Releases tab. Place the .exe in an empty folder where it will install STROOP. Make sure you have write permissions on the folder (you'll have to do this manually if you place it in Program Files).

The first time you run it, it has to install STROOP. If you want to open STROOP, run it again afterward.
